    "MOSFET stands for Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor",
    "MOSFETs operate at higher switching speeds and lower currents compared to BJTs",
    "MOSFETs require a very small gate current. It is often negligible unless the drain current is relatively small as well",
    "In 2014, Intel shipped devices with MOSFETs the size of 14nm",
    "The MOSFET was invented by Dawon Kahng and Martin M. Atalla at Bell Labs in 1959",
    "The MOSFET has three modes of operation: Cutoff, Triode, and Saturation",
    "If the gate and drain of the MOSFET are connected, it is operating in diode mode",
    "The Body terminal is the 4th terminal in a MOSFET, the other three are Gate, Drain, and Source",
    "The Body Effect is modeled as a change in the Threshold voltage",
    "The NMOS and PMOS are two common types of MOSFETs",
    "For small signal AC analysis of a MOSFET, either the pi model or the T model can be used",
    "In small signal AC analysis, a MOSFET is modelled as a voltage controlled current source"
