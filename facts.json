    "MOSFET stands for Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor",
    "MOSFETs operate at higher switching speeds and lower currents compared to BJTs",
    "MOSFETs require a very small gate current. It is often negligible unless the drain current is relatively small as well",
    "In 2014, Intel shipped devices with MOSFETs the size of 14nm",
    "The MOSFET was invented by Dawon Kahng and Martin M. Atalla at Bell Labs in 1959",
    "The MOSFET has three modes of operation: Cutoff, Triode, and Saturation",
    "If the gate and drain of the MOSFET are connected, it is operating in diode mode",
    "The Body terminal is the 4th terminal in a MOSFET, the other three are Gate, Drain, and Source",
    "The Body Effect is modeled as a change in the Threshold voltage",
    "The NMOS and PMOS are two common types of MOSFETs",
    "For small signal AC analysis of a MOSFET, either the pi model or the T model can be used",
    "In small signal AC analysis, a MOSFET is modelled as a voltage controlled current source",
    "The MOSFET has an oxide, Inversion Layer, Depletion layer, and bulk holes between the Gate and the Body",
    "Current flows through an N-type channel in an NMOS and a P-type channel in a PMOS",
    "The typical channel length of an NMOS ranges from 22nm to 5 um",
    "The NMOS has a p-type substrate and the PMOS has an n-type substrate",
    "The typical threshold voltage of an NMOS ranges from 0.3V to 1V",
    "In the triode mode of operation, the MOSFET behaves like a linear resistor", 
    "Channel length modulation is an effect discovered by James Early. Hence, it is also called the Early effect",
    "An ideal MOSFET has an infinite output resistance. In practice, this value is high but finite",
    "Single electron MOSFETs have been proposed which take advantage of the effects of quantum tunnelling"
