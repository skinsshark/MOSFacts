MOSFET stands for Metal oxide semiconducter field effect transistor
MOSFETS operate at higher switching speeds and lower currents compared to BJTs
MOSFETS require a very small gate current. It is often negligible unless the drain current is relatively small as well
In 2014, Intel shipped devices with MOSFETS the size of 14nm
The MOSFET was invented by Dawon Kahng and Martin M. Atalla at Bell labs in 1959
The MOSFET has three modes of operation: Cutoff, Triode, and Saturation
If the gate and drain of the MOSFET are connected, it is operating in diode mode
